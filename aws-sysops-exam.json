Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to theInternet. If a subnet's traffic is routed to an in-ternet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet. If a subnet doesn't have a route to the Inter-net gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet. If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html", "answer_disc": "https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/view/42/#", "answer_disc_count": "5"}, {"nr": 371, "question": "Which of the following services can receive an alert from CloudWatch?", "question_image": "NOIMAGE", "options": [{"item_letter": "A.", "item": "WS Elastic Block Store"}, {"item_letter": "B.", "item": "AWS Relational Database Service"}, {"item_letter": "C.", "item": "AWS Auto Scaling"}, {"item_letter": "D.", "item": "AWS Elastic Load Balancing"}], "answers": ["C."], "answer_description": "AWS Auto Scaling and Simple Notification Service (SNS) work in conjunction with CloudWatch.CloudWatch can send alerts to the AS policy or to the SNS end points.Reference:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/related_services.html", "answer_disc": "https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-sysops/view/43/#", "answer_disc_count": "2"}, {"nr": 372, "question": "A user creates an Auto Scaling group from the Amazon AWS Console and assigned a tag with a key of \"environment\" and a value of \"Prod\".
